/**
 * The local file system interface.

 * Implement this class so that your server can access the local file system that
 * you will implement. This class uses our Disk class for accessing disk blocks
 * on the underlying storage stack.
 *
 * One important aspect of this interface is that the buffers and sizes that
 * callers operate will not align on disk block boundaries, so your job is
 * to manage the interactions with the underlying storage to provide a higher
 * level of abstraction for any code that uses this class.
